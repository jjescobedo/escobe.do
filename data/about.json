  "info": "Welcome to my corner of the universe. This portfolio is a showcase of my passion for creative coding, interactive design, and building unique digital experiences from the ground up.\n\nEach project you see is a 'star system' I've brought to life, built with a variety of technologies and a deep focus on creating engaging, memorable user interfaces. I believe that the web should be a space for artistry and exploration, not just information.\n\nThis entire visualization—from the procedurally generated galaxy to the cinematic transitions—is written in vanilla JavaScript, using the HTML5 Canvas API to render every particle and planet. It's a testament to what can be achieved with foundational web technologies.\n\nFeel free to explore. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out. The universe of possibility is vast, and I'm always ready for the next journey.",
